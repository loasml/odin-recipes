    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate mousse is a soft prepared sweet or savory dish. It normally contains cream, egg (white and yolk), and sugar, and is often flavoured with chocolate, coffee, caramel, pur√©ed fruits, or various herbs and spices, such as mint or vanilla. In the case of some chocolate mousse, the chocolate is melted. Other chocolate mousse are egg-less and are prepared using gelatin as the setting agent. </p>
