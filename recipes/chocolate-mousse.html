    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate mousse is a soft prepared sweet or savory dish. It normally contains cream, egg (white and yolk), and sugar, and is often flavoured with chocolate, coffee, caramel, puréed fruits, or various herbs and spices, such as mint or vanilla. In the case of some chocolate mousse, the chocolate is melted. Other chocolate mousse are egg-less and are prepared using gelatin as the setting agent. </p>
