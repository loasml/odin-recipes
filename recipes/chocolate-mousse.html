    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate mousse is a soft prepared sweet or savory dish. It normally contains cream, egg (white and yolk), and sugar, and is often flavoured with chocolate, coffee, caramel, puréed fruits, or various herbs and spices, such as mint or vanilla. In the case of some chocolate mousse, the chocolate is melted. Other chocolate mousse are egg-less and are prepared using gelatin as the setting agent. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao is ideal)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter. </li>
        <li>Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, whisking, directly over medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, and hot to the touch (145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)).  </li>
        <li>Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and whisk until all chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the counter, whisking occasionally to further cool the mixture to just above or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture shouldn’t go into the whipped cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture may get too firm to fold in. </li>
        <li>Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, it will separate and the final texture will be grainy. </li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a spatula until almost incorporated. Gently fold in remaining chocolate, trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible. </li>
        <li>Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour. </li>
    </ol>
